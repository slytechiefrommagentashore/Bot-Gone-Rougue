#  Bot Gone Rogue — Mission Control
## 🏆Winner: Chaos Street Legend (2nd Overall) @ Maximally GTA ’25
## Ranked #2 out of 279 Participants

A chaotic, humor-filled 2D browser game where your AI office assistant starts misinterpreting your commands.  
Built for the **Hackathon: “The Heist — Chaos Mode”**, this project blends automation, AI personality, and unpredictable mayhem into one rogue experience.

##  Inspiration
Inspired by the surge of humanoid robots like **NEO**, I wondered — what if one misunderstood simple office commands?  
I’ve always loved 2D mechanics, so I turned that idea into an interactive chaos simulator where *automation goes off the rails*.

---

##  What It Does
You play as the human operator trying to manage a slightly rebellious AI assistant.

-  Issue commands like `Clean Desk`, `Fix Computer`, or `Make Coffee`
-  Each command either helps or increases the **Chaos Level**
-  Survive at least 10 commands to unlock **Shutdown**
-  Keep Chaos under 40% and execute “Shutdown” to win
-  Let it hit 100%... and the office explodes.

---

##  How It Works
Built entirely in **HTML5 + JavaScript**, powered by the **Phaser 3** framework.

### Game Systems:
- **Chaos Engine:** Every action carries a calculated risk.
- **Score System:** Gain points for success; get bonuses for calm conditions.
- **Bot Personality:** The bot reacts differently as chaos rises.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard shortcuts (1-7, H for hint, Enter to restart).
- **Game States:** Intro → Gameplay → Game Over (Success or Failure).

##  Key Features
| Mechanic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|  Chaos Level | Dynamic bar that drives risk & difficulty |
|  Bot Personality | Changes tone & reactions based on chaos |
|  Local High Score | Persists top performance between sessions |
|  Keyboard Controls | 1–7 for commands, H for hints, Enter to restart |
|  Humor Layer | Occasional “Tell me a joke” command to lighten the chaos |

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** HTML5, JavaScript (ES6)
- **Framework:** [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3)
- **Assets:** AI-generated bot & glitch visuals (Nano)
- **Audio:** Sound effects from Pixabay
- **Hosting:** Vercel (public, instant-load deployment)

---

##  Accomplishments
- Designed and balanced a chaos-based mechanic that feels unpredictable but fair  
- Created a reactive “AI personality” using only simple rules  
- Achieved smooth performance, clean UI, and full accessibility with no frameworks other than Phaser  

---

##  Challenges
- Balancing risk and reward for each command  
- Preventing repetition and “bot boredom” logic  
- Making the shutdown sequence feel earned  
- Handling multiple overlays (intro, game, game over) cleanly within Phaser’s scene  

---

##  What I Learned
- Game design is 80% balancing, 20% coding  
- Phaser 3 is incredibly flexible for quick prototyping  
- A single variable (“chaos”) can drive both narrative and gameplay dynamics  

---

##  What’s Next
-  **New Story Modes** (Survival, Endless, Office Uprising)  
-  **Difficulty Tiers** — Easy, Medium, Hard  
-  **Leaderboard System** — global scores & chaos rankings  
-  **Expanded Bot Dialogue** — more personality and humor  
-  **Mobile Version** of the current game.
